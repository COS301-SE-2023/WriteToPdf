## Branching strategy
The main branch is the live/deployed branch.
Test branch is used to run all tests.
A feature branch will be created for each feature being worked on.

Merge feature branches into test, then merge test into main.


## Git Structure
We follow a monorepo strategy with both the frontend and backend code in the same repository to allow for easier code management and more streamlined testing.


## Organisation & Management
We use <a href="https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WriteToPdf/issues">Github Issues</a> and <a href="https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/WriteToPdf/projects?query=is%3Aopen">Github Projects</a> to organise our team, with different members being assigned to specific tasks to ensure effective use of each member’s time.
