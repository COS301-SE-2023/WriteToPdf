<!-- ## Branching strategy
The main branch is the live/deployed branch.
Test branch is used to run all tests. These two branches are the stable branches.
The codecov branch is used to merge completed features into and is the branch where tests get fixed before being pushed to the Test branch.
Feature branches get created off of the Test branch and be called dev/feature_name. Once a feature is completed it gets merged into codecov.

The flow of merging is: dev/feature -> codecov -> test -> main


## Repository Structure
The repository follows a well-organised structure to meet our client's requirements and ensures efficient development and maintenance. It consists of the following folders:
```
.
|-- /frontend
|-- /backend
|-- /infrastructure
```

The `frontend` folder holds all the code related to the user-facing interface and the client-side functionality. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any relevant assets.

The `backend` folder contains the server-side code responsible for handling data processing, business logic, and integration with external services. This includes server-side programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.

To address the need for infrastructure as code, the `infrastructure` folder houses all the necessary configurations and scripts for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure components. This allows for automated and reproducible deployment and scaling of the application.

By structuring the repository in this manner, we maintain a clear separation of concerns, enabling efficient collaboration and ease of maintenance across different parts of the project. -->
