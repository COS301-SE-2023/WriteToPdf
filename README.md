## :clipboard: Description
WriteToPdf is an app designed to make your life easier by converting your handwritten
notes and documents into digital text that you can easily edit, store, and share. Our app
uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology to accurately recognize handwriting
and convert it into digital text. It also provides a web-based browser editor and saves all
your information and documents online.  
The rich text editor will allow you to make alterations to the scanned in text as well as
append scanned text to documents that are already in progress. From there, one can
export each document to different document formats, which include PDF, markdown,
HTML, text and image formats.  
Our app is capable of recognizing tables, making it easier to create, organise and format
your notes and documents. First implementations of the app will aim to achieve the
OCR and table recognition functionality. However, in the future, we're planning to add
features that will allow our app to recognize images and drawings on handwritten
notes, making it easier to capture your ideas and creations in a digital format.
